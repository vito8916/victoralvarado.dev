    building web and mobile products that solve real business problems.

Over the past 9+ years, I’ve worked across product design, full-stack development, and AI integrations — helping teams ship faster, reduce infrastructure costs, and launch scalable platforms used by thousands of people.

I specialize in Next.js, React, Astro, Supabase, and practical AI workflows that improve delivery without adding unnecessary complexity.
