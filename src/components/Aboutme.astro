<p>
    This is not just a portfolio or a resume about me. My intention is to create a kind of autobiography of my professional life.
    I want to share my experiences, my knowledge, how I started and also where I'm going in this fantastic world that many of us call Software.
</p>

<h2 class="section-title">
    Small summary of what I do
</h2>

<h3>
    So, in simple words:
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        I analyze.
    </li>
    <li>
        I design.
    </li>
    <li>
        I code.
    </li>
    <li>
        And most importantly, I reach the business goals solving problems with code.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>
    ðŸ¤” How do I do it?
</h3>
<p>
    I try to understand the business, the goals, and the needs.
    I also try to apply the software development life cycle (SDLC), that consists of:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Project Planning:</b> The 'What do we want?' stage with emphasis on cost estimation and requirement definition.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Gathering Requirements & Analysis:</b> A stage where detailed client requirements are discussed and analyzed.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Design:</b> The translation of plans and visions into a Software Design Document.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Coding:</b> Time to code! It means translating the design into a computer language.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Testing:</b> A critical evaluation to ensure the software works as required.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Deployment:</b> The system is released for customers to use.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Maintenance:</b> The problems start when the customer starts using the system.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>
    What do I use?
</h3>
<p>
    I try to keep my stacks as simple as possible, I'm currently working with:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Frontend:</b> React, Next.Js, Astro Build, TailwindCSS, and ShadCN.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Backend:</b> Node.Js, Express, Firebase, MongoDB, and MySql, PHP.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Mobile:</b> React Native, Expo.
    </li>
</ul>

<!--<p>
    I've been working as a software engineer for more than 7 years, and I've had the opportunity to work with many
    companies around the world.
    In all these years I've learned a lot, I have worked with many languages and technologies in different projects,
    in different areas, and with different teams.
    I have worked as UI Designer, Frontend Developer, Backend Developer, Android Developer, and Full Stack
    Developer.
</p>
<p>
    Yes, I know! Maybe it's too much, but, you know what? I love it.
    And probably you are wondering, why do I have so many titles? Well, I think that the best way to learn is to do
    it, and I have always been curious to learn new things.
    I don't consider my self an expert in any of these areas, but I have a lot of experience in each of them.
    I have learned a lot from my mistakes, and I have learned a lot from my successes.
</p>
<p class="text-highlight">
    But, hey! I know that sometimes we have to settle down and focus on one thing, and that's why I'm currently
    working
    as a Full Stack Developer using technologies like <b>Next.Js, Astro Build, FireBase, MongoDB and, MySql</b>.
