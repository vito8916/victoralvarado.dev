    This is not just a portfolio or a resume about me. My intention is to create a kind of autobiography of my professional life.
    I want to share my experiences, my knowledge, how I started and also where I'm going in this fantastic world that many of us call Software.
</p>
<!--<p>
    I've been working as a software engineer for more than 7 years, and I've had the opportunity to work with many
    companies around the world.
    In all these years I've learned a lot, I have worked with many languages and technologies in different projects,
    in different areas, and with different teams.
    I have worked as UI Designer, Frontend Developer, Backend Developer, Android Developer, and Full Stack
    Developer.
</p>
<p>
    Yes, I know! Maybe it's too much, but, you know what? I love it.
    And probably you are wondering, why do I have so many titles? Well, I think that the best way to learn is to do
    it, and I have always been curious to learn new things.
    I don't consider my self an expert in any of these areas, but I have a lot of experience in each of them.
    I have learned a lot from my mistakes, and I have learned a lot from my successes.
</p>
<p class="text-highlight">
    But, hey! I know that sometimes we have to settle down and focus on one thing, and that's why I'm currently
    working
    as a Full Stack Developer using technologies like <b>Next.Js, Astro Build, FireBase, MongoDB and, MySql</b>.
