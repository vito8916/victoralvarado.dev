>A career that allowed me to explore my creativity and learn how to integrate it with software development.

## The Call of Creativity and the Discovery of Design

My adventure in graphic design began long before I can remember. Since I was a kid, I always loved drawing and creating new things, and as I grew up, I discovered that creativity was a fundamental part of my life.


I remember my early days using Paint on Windows XP, and how fun it was to create drawings and shapes with just a few clicks.
As I grew older, I discovered more advanced programs like Photoshop and Illustrator, and realized there was a whole world to explore.

#### It All Started with Photoshop

When I discovered that you could create photo montages and manipulate images with this software, I started experimenting and creating my own compositions.

Later on, I edited photos for my friends, and little by little, I improved my graphic design skills.

#### Time to Decide
When it was time to start my higher education and I had some doubts about which career to choose, I decided to take a diploma in graphic design as something temporary while I started studying Infotechnology Engineering and also to learn a bit more about graphic design.

#### The Graphic Design Career
I decided to study graphic design at Level 7 Studios, a design school in Tegucigalpa, Honduras. For two years, I learned to use programs like Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, and create designs for different media, like print, digital, and web.

By the end, I had discovered a new passion that would accompany me on my journey as an Infotechnology Engineer.

### The Union of Creativity and Logic

Graphic design taught me to think creatively. I learned to communicate ideas effectively and create designs that are not only visually appealing but also functional.

This career allowed me to explore my creativity and learn how to integrate it with software development, diving into areas like UI and UX, which has helped me become a better engineer and create products that are not only functional but also beautiful.
