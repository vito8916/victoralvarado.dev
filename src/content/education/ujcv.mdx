### Infotechnology: A Different Kind of Degree

You might find the name of this degree, **Infotechnology Engineering**, a bit strange or unfamiliar. You might be wondering, what is it? Where did it come from?

Well, in simple terms, it\`s the same old computer engineering. But, is it the same as other degrees or does it have something special?

To be honest, I\`m not entirely sure, but I can tell you that Infotechnology Engineering is structured into four blocks:
* Information and Communication Technologies.
* Digital Systems and Electronics.
* Software Engineering.
* Administration and Management.

If I had to highlight some differences with other similar degrees, they would be:
* Deep focus on information systems
* Information ecology
* Strategic planning
* Innovation management (**One of my favorites**)
* Project management
* Entrepreneurship and business development.

There might be more differences, but from my point of view, the ones mentioned above stand out the most.

There\`s another branch in this engineering curriculum that I\`d like to mention, and it\`s none other than Electronic Circuits.
A total waste of time and effort if you ask me. I mean, all knowledge is good, but there are 5 subjects related to Electronics that you can only take after passing 3 physics courses, and in the end, your knowledge in electronics is less than basic.

### My Journey at JosÃ© Cecilio del Valle University

From the start at this university, I set a goal to stand out as a student, especially in programming, which was already my favorite at the time.

Thanks to the determination and effort I put in, I achieved that goal, becoming known among my peers and teachers. I took my software development knowledge beyond the classes, researching and studying on my own to always stay ahead. This allowed me to share my knowledge with other classmates, forming study groups, providing tutoring, participating in talks, and competing in university-level contests. Of course, I couldn't have achieved this without the support of my teachers and close friends, who were an important part of the whole process.

But during my journey through this wonderful degree, I realized that it wasn't all about code or computing. Little by little, I discovered new subjects that I was deeply passionate about, like **Innovation Management**: a subject I fell in love with and learned a lot from. The knowledge I gained has been put into practice in my professional work and has given me a unique edge, allowing me to help in other areas of the companies I've worked for.

### Rocket's Adventure: A Fun and Challenging Project
One of the moments I remember most from my time at university was when I was invited to participate in a software development competition. The mission? Create something completely new as a team and present it to a panel of judges. Sounds simple, but trust me, it was quite a challenge.

Together with my teammate Ricardo Valladares, we had a week to develop a project that would showcase our skills. So, we decided to give it our all and create something that combined creativity and technique: a game we called *Rocketâ€™s Adventure*.
<div style="
    width: 100%;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-around;">
  <Image src={raMain} alt="Rocket's Adventure main menu." style="

  <Image src={raPlay} alt="Rocket's Adventure gameplay." style="
    width: 200px;
    height: 350px;" />
</div>
The idea was simple, create a mini-game (very popular at the time) where a rocket had to dodge obstacles and travel through space to discover new planets. The hard part? Neither Ricardo nor I had created a game before, but come on! What engineering student hasn't dreamed of creating their own game?

#### Let's Get to Work

The challenge was exciting and fun. We started working on the design and programming of the game, using Unity, C#, and Illustrator. With the help and support of our teachers, engineers Marco DÃ­az, Edgardo Ulloa, and the dean of the engineering faculty, we polished details and fine-tuned everything to be ready for the event.

The day of the competition arrived, and nervously we presented *Rocketâ€™s Adventure*; we thought we had no chance since it was just a poorly made game by two rookies, but at least the atmosphere was great.
Finally, they announced that we had won third place, we couldn't believe it because, again, it was just a poorly made game. But I have to admit it was a nice experience to see so many people enjoying and having fun playing it.
The moral of the story? I have two:
* Never underestimate something you think isn't good enough.
* Teamwork and creativity can take you very far.

### The end of a chapter, the beginning of something bigger

During the four years I spent at JosÃ© Cecilio del Valle University, I not only became a better programmer but also learned the importance of collaboration and pursuing your ideas until they become a reality. Looking back, I see those years as the start of something much bigger.
