                ü§öüèª Hi again! I'm Victor Alvarado, a Software Engineer, and Full Stack Developer. I'm from Honduras üá≠üá≥,
                a
                small
                country in Central America.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've been working as a software engineer for more than 7 years. <!--and I've had the opportunity to work
                        with many
                        companies around the world.-->
            </p>
            <p>In all these years I've learned a lot, I have worked with many languages and technologies. <!--in different
                        projects, in different areas, and with different teams.-->
                I have worked as UI Designer, Frontend Developer, Backend Developer, Android Developer, and Full
                Stack
                Developer.

        Yes, I know! Maybe it's too much, but, you know what? I love it.
        And probably you are wondering, why do I have so many titles? Well, I think that the best way to learn
        is to do
        it, and I have always been curious to learn new things.
        I don't consider my self an expert in any of these areas, but I have a lot of experience in each of
        them.
        I have learned a lot from my mistakes, and I have learned a lot from my successes.
    </p>

        But, hey! I know that sometimes we have to settle down and focus on one thing, and that's why I'm
        currently
        working
        as a Full Stack Developer using technologies like <b>Next.Js, Astro Build, FireBase, MongoDB and,
        MySql</b>.
